* Introduction

Powerline for Polybar is a utility set of pre-configured Polybar module templates.

An example being better than words, here's a quick look :

* Prerequisites and dependencies

  As this utility library is dedicated to be used with Polybar, i strongly advice you to install it. From now, I will
  assume you know the basis of Polybar configuration.

* Installation

  Installation is pretty straightforward: this repository is only composed of text files and Polybar configuration
  files. You only have to clone/download/rewrite files to somewhere on your system.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git clone https://www.github.com/bacara/powerline-for-polybar powerline-for-polybar
#+END_SRC

  Yay!

* Beginner's guide

  The file [[./powerline-for-polybar.config][file:powerline-for-polybar.config]] contains pre-configured templates to be inherited by your Polybar modules
  in order to your own build fancy Powerline setup. A good start is to include this file to your Polybar configuration
  file :

#+BEGIN_SRC ini
; My configuration file

include-file = /path/to/powerline-for-polybar/powerline-for-polybar.config
#+END_SRC

  In order to use a template for your modules, you have to make your module inherits from the template, and set a few
  parameters. In case examples in this document aren't comprehensive enough, don't hesitate to look inside
  [[./powerline-for-polybar.config][file:powerline-for-polybar.config]] for parameters that must be set, as they are documented along each templates. A
  generic example would be :

#+BEGIN_SRC ini
[module/my-module]
...
inherit      = <powerline-something>
<parameter1> = <background-color>
<parameter2> = <foreground-color>
...
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In this library, you will find two categories of objects to inherit from : =powerline-templates= and =powerline-modules=.
=powerline-templates= are meant to be inherited by your own modules, which mean you have to set the template parameters
*and* the parameters of your module (such as graphical properties, labels, formatting, ...). =powerline-modules= are
stand-alone modules that you only have to inherit from and set their parameters.
#+END_QUOTE

  Real parameters will be explained along the following examples.

** Simple Powerline bar

   Let take a look back at the first example (corresponding configuration file is
   [[./samples/1_simple-left-to-right.config][file:samples/1_simple-left-to-right.config]]):

   [[./img/1_simple-left-to-right.png][file:img/1_simple-left-to-right.png]]

   This bar is made out of 4 components (from left to right):

   * user-defined "logo" item ("Polybar" here, but your favorite distribution's logo will work fine)
   * CPU load monitor module
   * RAM usage monitor module
   * Current window title display

   To build one of the first three item (those Powerline fancy things), you only need to know the background color you
   want for this item, and the background color of the next (in line direction) item.

   The template used in this example is =powerline-templates/left-to-right-item=. First, make your module inherit from the
   template inside their configuration section.

#+BEGIN_SRC ini
inherit        = powerline-templates/left-to-right-item
#+END_SRC

   And add the needed background colors: =background= is the background for the current item, and =background-next= is the
   background of the next item (or bar's background for the last item).

#+BEGIN_SRC ini
background      = <insert-current-item-background-color>
background-next = <insert-next-item-background-color>
#+END_SRC

   Once this is explained and looking back at the sample, here's the code to build each of its Powerline modules:

   * Logo module

#+BEGIN_SRC ini
[module/logo]

; Powerline-for-Polybar settings
inherit            = powerline-templates/left-to-right-item
background         = ${colors.red}
background-next    = ${colors.yellow}

; Other settings
type               = custom/text
content-background = ${self.background}
content-foreground = ${colors.black}
content            = " Polybar "
#+END_SRC

   * CPU module

#+BEGIN_SRC ini
[module/cpu]

; Powerline-for-Polybar settings
inherit           = powerline-templates/left-to-right-item
background        = ${colors.yellow}
background-next   = ${colors.green}

; Other settings
type              = internal/cpu
format-background = ${self.background}
format-foreground = ${colors.black}
label             = " CPU: %percentage%% "
#+END_SRC

   * RAM module

#+BEGIN_SRC ini
[module/memory]

; Powerline-for-Polybar settings
inherit           = powerline-templates/left-to-right-item
background        = ${colors.green}
background-next   = ${root.background}

; Other settings
type              = internal/memory
format-background = ${self.background}
format-foreground = ${colors.black}
label             = " RAM: %percentage_used%% "
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Special case: as the RAM module is the last Powerline item of its line, =background-next= shall be set to the bar's
background color (which can be easily reached using =${root.background}=).
#+END_QUOTE

And finally, add a Powerline-supporting font and modules lists in your bar configuration:

#+BEGIN_SRC ini
[bar/my-bar]
...
height = 20
font-X = "Inconsolata for Powerline:pixelsize=15:antialias=true;3"
...
modules-left   = logo cpu memory
modules-center = xwindow
...
#+END_SRC

TADA! You should now have a bar looking more or less like this first sample, assuming you got your colors/fonts
configuration right.

Note that template is also available in right-to-left, using corresponding template names. For right-to-left lines,
consider the rightmost item is the starting item while the leftmost is the ending one. The sample configuration file for
the right-to-left equivalent of this example is [[./samples/3_simple-right-to-left.config][file:samples/3_simple-right-to-left.config]].

[[./img/3_simple-right-to-left.png][file:img/3_simple-right-to-left.png]]

** Separator-including Powerline bar

Another, slightly more complicated example, is a Powerline bar including separators between items (corresponding
configuration file is [[./samples/4_separated-left-to-right.config][file:samples/4_separated-left-to-right.config]]):

[[./img/4_separated-left-to-right.png][file:img/4_separated-left-to-right.png]]

  The template used in this example is =powerline-templates/left-to-right-item-with-separator=. Expected keys are
  =background= for the current item background, and =separator= corresponding to the separator color.

  There are two subtle things with this template :

  * For the first item of the line (leftmost in this case), you have to use a specific template:
    =powerline-templates/left-to-right-starting-item-with-separator=. This template uses the same parameters as above.
  * At the end of the line, you have to insert a small module inheriting from the standalone module
    =powerline-modules/left-to-right-end-of-line-separator=, which only needs a =background= value.

  In order to build this sample, here's the code:

  * Bar settings

#+BEGIN_SRC ini
[bar/my-bar]
...
height = 20
font-X = "Inconsolata for Powerline:pixelsize=15:antialias=true;3"
...
modules-left   = logo cpu memory end-of-line
modules-center = xwindow
...
#+END_SRC

  * Logo module (using the starting item template)

#+BEGIN_SRC ini
[module/logo]

; Powerline settings
inherit            = powerline-templates/left-to-right-starting-item-with-separator
background         = ${colors.red}
separator          = ${colors.black}

; Other settings
type               = custom/text
content-background = ${self.background}
content-foreground = ${colors.black}
content            = " Polybar "
#+END_SRC

  * CPU module

#+BEGIN_SRC ini
[module/cpu]

; Powerline settings
inherit            = powerline-templates/left-to-right-item-with-separator
background         = ${colors.yellow}
separator          = ${colors.black}

; Other settings
type               = internal/cpu
format-background  = ${self.background}
format-foreground  = ${colors.black}
label              = " CPU: %percentage%% "
#+END_SRC

  * RAM module

#+BEGIN_SRC ini
[module/memory]

; Powerline settings
inherit            = powerline-templates/left-to-right-item-with-separator
background         = ${colors.green}
separator          = ${colors.black}

; Other settings
type               = internal/memory
format-background  = ${self.background}
format-foreground  = ${colors.black}
label              = " RAM: %percentage_used%% "
#+END_SRC

  * End-of-line separator

#+BEGIN_SRC ini
[module/end-of-line]

; Powerline settings
inherit            = powerline-modules/left-to-right-end-of-line-separator
separator          = ${colors.black}
#+END_SRC

You should now have something like this ([[./samples/6_separated-left-to-right-noborder.config][file:samples/6_separated-left-to-right-noborder.config]]):

[[./img/6_separated-left-to-right-noborder.png][file:img/6_separated-left-to-right-noborder.png]]

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In case you forget to use the =powerline-templates/left-to-right-starting-item-with-separator= for the first module, this
is what to expect, but might be intended ([[./samples/5_separated-left-to-right-nostarting-noborder.config][file:samples/5_separated-left-to-right-nostarting-noborder.config]]):

[[./img/5_separated-left-to-right-nostarting-noborder.png][file:img/5_separated-left-to-right-nostarting-noborder.png]]
#+END_QUOTE

My opinion being that separator-including lines look far better with borders, let's add them to finish building up our
current example :

#+BEGIN_SRC ini
[bar/my-bar]
...
border-left-size   = 2
border-top-size    = 2
border-right-size  = 2
border-bottom-size = 2
border-color       = #ffffff
...
#+END_SRC

[[./img/4_separated-left-to-right.png][file:img/4_separated-left-to-right.png]]

Again, right-to-left equivalent is available ([[./samples/7_separated-right-to-left.config][file:samples/7_separated-right-to-left.config]]):

[[./img/7_separated-right-to-left.png][file:img/7_separated-right-to-left.png]]

* Workspaces display

  As of now, designing a workspaces display area in your bar requires specific settings because of two reasons : (1) no
  prefix/suffix formatting is actually possible (2) it depends on your windows manager.

  Being an exclusive user of i3, i'll only explain the needed configuration for this window manager only.

** i3

   For technical reasons i won't explain in here, you must include a separator between your workspaces for the best
   visual appearance. Thus, you need to choose the colors you'll use from here (you should have the #rrggbb hexadecimal
   format) :

   * general background color, which will be the color of your separators,
   * background and foreground color of your mode indicator,
   * background and foreground color of focused workspace,
   * background and foreground color of unfocused workspace,
   * background and foreground color of visible workspace,
   * background and foreground color of urgent workspace.

  I won't explain in details how to build your own, things are pretty simple and straightforward. Just take a look at my
  configuration, cleaned of any "non-relevant to this scenario" settings.

  Chosen colors :
   * General background color : #000000
   * Mode indicator : #802929 (background) and #000000 (foreground)
   * Focused workspace : #427241 (background) and #ffffff (foreground)
   * Unfocused workspace : #303030 (background) and #999999 (foreground)
   * Visible workspace : #4f6a5a (background) and #ffffff (foreground)
   * Urgent workspace : #802929 (background) and #ffffff (foreground)

#+BEGIN_SRC ini
[module/workspaces]
type            = internal/i3
format          = "<label-state><label-mode>"

label-mode-padding          = 0
label-mode                  = "%{B#802929 F#000000}  %mode%  %{B#000000 F#802929}"

label-focused-padding       = 0
label-focused               = "%{B#427241 F#000000}%{B#427241 F#ffffff}  %name%  %{B#000000 F#427241}"

label-unfocused-padding     = ${self.label-focused-padding}
label-unfocused             = "%{B#303030 F#000000}%{B#303030 F#999999}  %name%  %{B#000000 F#303030}"

label-visible-padding       = ${self.label-focused-padding}
label-visible               = "%{B#4f6a5a F#000000}%{B#4f6a5a F#FFFFFF}  %name%  %{B#000000 F#4f6a5a}"

label-urgent-padding        = ${self.label-focused-padding}
label-urgent                = "%{B#802929 F#000000}%{B#802929 F#ffffff}  %name%  %{B#000000 F#802929}"
#+END_SRC

   And the final result (of course, to be included inside a well-configured poly-power-bar, see above). The first
   following sample shows workspaces display only, and the second one shows workspaces display with a prepended i3 mode
   indicator.

[[./img/deep-ux_workspaces_i3.png][file:img/deep-ux_workspaces_i3.png]]

[[./img/deep-ux_workspaces_mode_i3.png][file:img/deep-ux_workspaces_mode_i3.png]]

* Reference sheet

  *[WORK IN PROGRESS]*

* Future works

  * Add support for workspaces, maybe through user-redefined template. A bit conky, but we can't do best 'til
    prefix/sufix for independant workspace is released (will it?).
